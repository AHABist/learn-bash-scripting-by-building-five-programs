# Learn Bash Scripting by Building Five Programs

> Welcome to the Bash Scripting lessons!

## 10. Start the Terminal

### 10.1

**The first thing you need to do is start the terminal.** Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type `echo hello terminal` into the terminal and press enter.

#### HINTS

- Capitalization matters
- If the tests don't run automatically, try typing `exit` into the terminal and redoing the instructions
